# Services e.g. warm storage are configured by `services/warm/sst.config.js`
# however even though seed.run execs `cd services/warm` before build the SST
# build command still builds in the root directory. The deploy command however
# looks in `services/warm/.sst` for the build artifacts. This `before_deploy`
# script simply copies the `.sst` directory from the root to the service path
# so that the deploy succeeds.
